# Spectroscopic data animation of the starfield view from a satellite in Earth orbit
> Animated plot of the starfield as viewed in the velocity direction of a satelitte using TLE propagated data.
> Obtains the details for stars in Field of View  and their intrinsic stellar spectra then plots Number of photons recieved vs wavelegth, and the Absorption Spectra of the FOV light

## General info
A parameter file [init_parameter.txt](./init_parameter.txt) is created using configparser module in python by running [Params_configparser.py]((./Params_configparser.py)) file
As the satellite moves around the orbit, the sky view rendered as seen by a camera positioned in the direction of velocity vector.  
TLE (Two-Line Elements) is used for calculating positions around orbit. For any given valid satellite in space, TLE's can be acquired from [Celestrak](https://celestrak.org/NORAD/documentation/gp-data-formats.php) using its NORAD id. 
TLE of the satellites can be added to the parameter file <Satellite.txt> using the creator Python file <Satellite_configparser.py>.
&nbsp;   
Hipparcos Catalogue is used for star details and the fields extracted are      
Field H1: Hipparcos number
Field H5: V magnitude    
Fields H8–9:  The right ascension, α , and declination, δ (in degrees)  
Field H11: Trigonometric Parallax
Field H37: Johnson B-V color
Field H76: Spectral Type
&nbsp; 
We obtain the stellar spectra THE STELLAR ATMOSPHERE MODELS BY CASTELLI AND KURUCZ 2004
we calculate the star's temperature and effective gravity using its spectral type. 
We assume all stars have the same metal abundance = solar metallicity.
&nbsp; 
Jayant Murthy's code: ascl:1512.012
We converted the following functions into python and used them in our code
1. GET_STAR_TEMP
2. READ_CASTELLI_SPECTRA
3. GET_SPECTRA
4. GET_SCALE_FACTOR
&nbsp;
      



## Method   
1.  Satellite position and velocity is calculated from TLE propagation using [sgp4](https://pypi.org/project/sgp4/) library. 
2.  Right Ascension(RA) and declination(DEC) are derived from the velocity vector.   
3.  Retrieve those star details that falls within a threshold magnitude and a Field of View defined by the camera.
4.  Obtain the starlight function (Intrinsic spectra) for each star in the FOV, Scale it to Number of photons recieved per area of detector.
5.  Plot and animate the satellite position around the earth and the starfield view as seen by the satellite.
6.  Plot the number of photons vs wavelength for all stars per FOV
7.  Plot absorption spectra for star light as it would like spread over a spectroscopic detector.
